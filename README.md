# Fprime's Audio Engine

Fprime's Audio Engine is an audio creation device capable of generating sound. The sounds created by the engine are programmable, by adding a new "voice" and selecting a "note" and "octave" value, one can then hold the "hold to play button" to hear that note. A user can add as many voices as they would like in theory, however GUI constraints do exist. Additionally, the tone of the sound may be adjusted through a couple of different methods. Users can switch the wave type from a basic sinusoidal wave into a saw, square, or triangle wave instead. There exists 3 fields labelled "bass", "mid", & "treble", which operate on a scale from 0-1.0(inclusive). By adjusting the ratio of these three fields, one can slightly alter the dominant sound created by the wave / alter the "tone" of the sound. 

If you wish to see additional functionality, please open an Issue in the GitHub repository [Link at the bottom] and be specific as to what you would like, what its intended use is, and why it should be added.

Fprime's Audio Engine is fully open-source, meaning anyone can clone, modify, distribute, and alter this software as they please.
